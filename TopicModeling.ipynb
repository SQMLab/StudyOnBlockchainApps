         "[\"Fix policy condition calculation ### Description When constructing the `Condition` struct we recursively call `get_condition` on all the items in a threshold and short-circuit if there's an error somewhere (for example, because the policy-path hasn't been provided for a specific threshold). This can cause issues when the user doesn't care about a subtree, because we still try to call `get_condition` on all the items and fail if something is missing, even if the specific subtree isn't selected and won't be used later on. This commit changes the logic so that we first filter only the `selected` items, and then unwrap the error using the question mark. If errors happened somewhere else they will be ignored, as they should. ### Notes to the reviewers I think it makes sense to backport this to `0.27`: even though it's not a critical issue (and there's a workaround[^1] for the bug) it may be a while before the new `1.0` is released. I wouldn't do a release just for this, but I would just leave it there and maybe in a few weeks if there are other fixes to be backported to pre-1.0 they could all be released. ### Changelog notice - Fixed a bug in the policy condition calculation ### Checklists #### All Submissions: * [x] I've signed all my commits * [x] I followed the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) * [x] I ran `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before committing #### New Features: * [ ] I've added tests for the new feature * [ ] I've added docs for the new feature #### Bugfixes: * [ ] This pull request breaks the existing API * [x] I've added tests to reproduce the issue which are now passing * [ ] I'm linking the issue being fixed by this PR [^1]: The workaround is to simply set the items in the policy tree even if they won't be used. For example, if the item causing troubles is a `thresh(1, ...)` just set `[0]` in the policy path for that id.\", 'Uniswap \"Connect Smart Wallet\" On Mac OS Failure Error **Bug Description** When trying to connect any smart wallet to Uniswap on Mac OS, a fatal error occurs and a \"Try again\" button appears immediately, and cannot progress past this. This bug got progressively worse, noticed about 7pm PCT. Prior, the wallet would connect and the transaction would be confirmed in the wallet, however the transaction would stay \"Pending\" with no progress. You could manually confirm the transaction multiple times in V1 of uniswap, however no progress will be made. As of now on Mac OS I cannot connect a smart wallet to either uniswap version. **Steps to Reproduce** 1. Go to Connect Wallet 2. Click on Wallet Connect option 3. The error should appear and no refresh will help the page move and function normally. ... **Expected Behavior** After clicking connect smart wallet from the wallet options, the window will open and close right away telling you to try again. No attempt can made to actually try to connect. No QR code will appear, only a \"try again\" button. **Additional Context** Uniswap seems to have trouble communicating with smart wallets at this time. As prior to this, it was connecting and working as expected. Within hours, it would connect, but bug out, and not complete transactions, regardless of approval of contract, or auto approval, despite there being sufficient funds.', '\"You need to select more coins!\" when editing a \"speed up\" transaction **Describe the bug** The \"Speed up\" button allows to \"Fully edit the transaction\", which is great when there\\'s no change output (#988), but it fails to create the new transaction. It\\'s probably because the inputs of the original transaction are considered spent, and thus don\\'t appear in the coin selection list. **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. Have an unconfirmed transaction in a wallet 2. Click on \\'Speed up\\' 3. Enter the new fee rate 4. Click on \"Advanced\" and \"Fully edit the transaction\" 5. Notice the inputs of the original transaction don\\'t appear in the coin selection table 6. Click on \"Create the unsigned transaction\" 7. It says \"You need to select more coins!\" **Expected behavior** - Either the new transaction should be created with the new fee rate and the same inputs, - or the UI should allow the selection of the same inputs as in the replaced transaction **Desktop:** - Where is your node running: local(internal) - Where is your specter running: binary - If you\\'re running a binary, which OS: Linux - Browser: electron - Specter Version: tested on 2.0.0, 2.0.1, and 2.0.2pre6 **Additional context** It seems the code checks if there\\'s enough coins selected by looking at the selected rows whereas there\\'s no row for the spent outputs. The internal `selected-coins` list may contain the right coins though.']"

Example below: Two separate users running the above ledger versions attempted to send IBC-denominated ATOM from one Osmosis address to another Osmosis address. They received the following error code and the transaction failed: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95544279/169592478-15599794-5cbf-4a36-b795-fd1eb62576ce.png) Note that the above error code occurred both on the Keplr UI and attempting this same transaction via CLI I was able to process this send with no issues from one wallet to another, but the wallets I used were not tied to a ledger. Based on that I think it's pretty likely that ledger is the cause of the issue here.

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3. Trade happens, which removes the open offer 4. We load offers and **see no open offers**. Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1. On centralized exchanges, there is no atomic way by which we can do both: load offers and trades a. this is not an issue with SDEX because this can be done atomically 2. We have currently implemented fill tracking as a separate thread and cannot exactly predict when it will run the fill trackers; *this needs to be made more predictable* This bug can be fixed by: - [x] introduce a new config entry in trader.cfg: `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` and `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` - [x] fetch trades immediately after loading offers [somewhere here](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/trader/trader.go#L169). - [x] add checks to ensure atomicity of (offers, balances, trades): load offers and balances, load trades, reload offers and balances -- if both results of loading offers (and balances) are the same then it means nothing has changed during this window, otherwise reload trades and then reload offers (and balances) and recheck. If this fails `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` times then crash bot. - [x] update documentation so that it is clear that you do not need to set `FILL_TRACKER_SLEEP_MILLIS` to fetch trades and can use `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` instead, which is a cheaper and more consistent alternative - there is a valid use case to still want to track fills every X seconds in addition to using the new config (such as the mirror strategy). Strategies such as the balanced strategy could switch over to using this new field though. - [x] [remove this line in sample_trader.cfg](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/examples/configs/trader/sample_trader.cfg#L37) since fill tracking is supported in non-SDEX exchanges - [x] testing ## Your Environment cli version: master:nightly-33ab2afe-17-g8f927d83 gui version: v1.0.0-rc1 git branch: master git hash: 8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635 build date: 20200723T104331Z env: dev GOOS: linux GOARCH: amd64 ## Context I am unable to reliably run a trading strategy that depends on having consistent trade data because of this. relates to #306 and can be a possible solution.

connecting to the backend & not running Tor. I have had the same problem in the last few weeks and I really tried to solve the issue. I have found a lot of different suggestions on Reddit and I thought it would be helpful to summarize them in one thread on Git. I'll also let you know what worked for me. **Problem:** Wasabi always worked perfectly fine for me. Suddenly it stopped working, Wallet didn't run Tor anymore and for that reason I wasn't able to send transactions, set fees, CoinJoin etc. In the Log File I received this error messages: `2020-05-23 21:08:30 INFO TorProcessManager (294) Tor did not work properly for 364 seconds. Maybe it crashed. Attempting to start it... 2020-05-23 21:08:31 INFO TorProcessManager (105) Updating Tor... 2020-05-23 21:08:32 INFO TorProcessManager (176) Extracted C:\\\\Program Files\\\\WasabiWallet\\\\TorDaemons\\\\data-folder.zip to C:\\\\Users\\\\XXXX\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\WalletWasabi\\\\Client\\\\tor. 2020-05-23 21:08:32 INFO TorProcessManager (182) Extracted C:\\\\Program Files\\\\WasabiWallet\\\\TorDaemons\\\\tor-win32.zip to C:\\\\Users\\\\XXXX\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\WalletWasabi\\\\Client\\\\tor. 2020-05-23 21:08:32 INFO TorProcessManager (139) Starting Tor process with Process.Start. 2020-05-23 21:08:36 ERROR TorProcessManager (165) WalletWasabi.Exceptions.TorException: Could not automatically start Tor.

Is the log similar to the one above? Congrats, you probably have the same issue as me. - Open the Tor Logs under **File > Open > Tor Log File** and check if you can find something interesting there. I had only Logs from the last time Wasabi worked properly. - Open Tor Browser and check if it works on .com and .onion sites. Despite it worked fine for me, I re-installed it and Wasabi worked for one evening but stopped working the next day - same issue again. After re-installing it you should first open Tor and then Wasabi Wallet - Turn Tor off under **Tools > Settings > Tor**, restart Wasabi, turn Tor on again and restart Wasabi. - Go to **C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\User\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Roaming\\\\\\\\tor\\\\\\\\** on Windows and delete the **cached-microdesc-consensus** file. Restart Wasabi and reboot the OS. - Uninstall Wasabi, delete the Tor folder and the WalletWasabi Folder under **C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\User\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Roaming\\\\\\\\** and install Wasabi Wallet again. **MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR RECOVERY SEED + PASSWORD!!!** **- FINAL SOLUTION FOR ME:** 1. Go to **Tools > Settings > Tor > Tor SOCKS5 Endpoint** and put a 1 behind the 9 instead of the 0 so it says :9150 as Port. 2. Run Tor Browser 3. Run Wasabi Wallet Then you have to wait a few minutes after everything is installed.\"]"

No one should have over the voting threshold in reputation(default is 70%), 2. Disable the Reputation monitor so that it does not fast forward you through the Motion on each transaction - http://localhost:3001/reputation/monitor/toggle 3. Create a Motion 4. Fully stake with one member and fully object with the other member on the Motion to get to a Vote. 5. Vote on the Motion. This may take a couple of tries to get, as it was not happening every time. It was first reported by DAO Club on mainnet and I have replicated it locally following this process. Note: I have noticed that this seems to fix it self once all people have voted. i.e. the vote is being detected, however, the reveal option is visible one all people have voted. The same issue seems to also happen with the \"Reveal\" button, i.e. all people need to reveal, before it is update in the UI for each person that they clicked the reveal button. ## Expected behaviour * The vote should be detected, let the user know their vote, but also allow them to change their vote. * Clicking the reveal button should notify the user that they have successfully revealed their vote. ## Actual behaviour * Voting was not detected, and user can vote multiple times. * Reveal button does not notify the user that they successfully clicked the reveal button. ![vote-not-saving](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33682027/193401969-a74a4ae6-89a0-4ca3-b121-0eac9a1dcac1.gif)', 'Fix Successful Permissions Management Motions Titles (Permissions Comparisons) ## Description Up until now, the way the _Permission Management_ motions titles would be generated was that we took the \"current\" user permission and compare them with what the motion was changing through the bitMask _(you can\\'t tell otherwise which one was changed, you can only see the \"final\" state of the permission after the motion passes)_ In theory this works ok, however, once the motion to change the permissions passes, and you refresh the page, you\\'ll end up comparing the \"current\" user permissions _(which were already changed by the motion)_ to the ones that the motion is trying to set. _(which now are the same, so we can\\'t actually tell what changed)_ This PR fixes this by get **historic user roles** by limiting the events we look for to determine roles to the block that the motion was created in. This way we get all the roles _up to_ the block in which the motion was started, and compare them with the roles that the motion is setting currently. These values will always be different so we will always be able to determine what changed. To make this work, I had to add a new helper to `colonyJS` called `getHistoricColonyRoles` **Testing** - **Make sure to run `npm i` to bring in the new version of `colonyJS`** - Create a _Permission Management_ motion and pass it _(the titles both in the motion page and in the actions list, should be the same both before the motion passed and after the motion passed)_ To test the opposite: - go to a different branch, that doesn\\'t have this fix _(eg: `feature/reputation-voting`)_ - Create a _Permission Management_ motion and pass it _(after it passes, the title will change to \"Generic motion we don\\'t have any information about...\")_ Resolves DEV-395', \"Fix mint tokens and unlock tokens dialog actions not showing - Added a `canColonyMintNativeToken` field to the `ProcessedColony` fragment to determine if the colony (independent of the user's permissions) can mint/unlock their native/default token. - Updated previous `canMintNativeToken` field to `canUserMintNativeToken`, as this field specifically checks if the user can mint tokens, not the colony. - Updated `TokenMintForm` and `ManageFundsDialog` and `ManageFundsDialog` validation based on changes mentioned above. - **NEW:** Added a new redux action called `USER_CONNECTED` to let `ColonyHomeActions` know whether the wallet is finished loading in. **What to test:** - Colony with a native token as the default: - As a root user, you should be able to mint and unlock the token using the UAC or manage funds page. If the motion and disputes extension is installed, you should be able to create a motion to mint or force it. - As a non-root user, you should _not_ be able to mint and unlock the token, at all. If the motion and disputes extension is installed, you should be able to create a motion to mint tokens. - Colony with a non-native token as the default: - As ANY user, you should NOT see the `Mint tokens` and `Unlock tokens` entries inside the UAC and the option to mint tokens in the manage funds page should be disabled. - **NEW:** When the dapp hasn't fully loaded the connected wallet or the extensions, you should be shown a loading state where the `New action` button is supposed to be in order to prevent you from clicking it. This is done to avoid the following scenarios: - If the wallet is not fully loaded, then the UAC won't be able to tell if the user can mint, unlock tokens, and potentially won't be able to do other actions that require permissions. - If the extensions are not fully loaded, then the UAC won't know, for example, if the motion & disputes extension is installed and therefore show the actions as if the extension wasn't installed.

Steps to reproduce: - connect to LNC node - modify host to something unreachable - click \"save\" -> Zeus will reconnect to old host... The root cause was that serverHost was being stored in two places: within the main credentials object and as part of the persisted data. When loading credentials, the old serverHost value from persisted data was overriding the new host setting. -> Fixed this by separating serverHost storage into its own dedicated storage location and implementing proper migration to handle existing data.

         "[\"Remove noise from scene console Whenever you open the browser console to a scene, it's covered in messages that are irrelevant to you as a scene creator. Many of these are warnings or even errors, which can be very misleading. People in Discord often ask about these whenever they run into a completely unrelated problem, making them waste a lot of time going down a false path. ALL information in the console when running `dcl start` should be relevant to the scope of creating a scene. Anything else is noise. If you just set up a default scene and open the console you'll see a lot. Here's what I see in an empty scene, the scene has essentially nothing, I think just a cube. And it's already producing all of this literature: These entire four pages are all noise. Out of all that, the only bits that have some minor justification to be there are the following: Everything else is noise. Some of these irrelevant messages only seem to appear in larger scenes. Here are some more specific examples I fished from running Genesis Plaza locally: https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/Genesis-Plaza\", \"Spawn point checking inclusive to limits This issue started happening recently Several scenes that used to work stopped loading, without having changed at all, just updating to 6.6.3. It was really hard to debug what was going on. Here's a scene that loads fine in 6.6.1 but doesn't load in 6.6.3, it stays stuck in the loading screen: [https://app.zenhub.com/files/220994476/4563d7c9-b4a3-4bd6-bc55-831ac1f2c896/download](https://app.zenhub.com/files/220994476/4563d7c9-b4a3-4bd6-bc55-831ac1f2c896/download) What we discovered through a lot of debugging is that if we change the spawn point x coordinate to 31 instead of 32, it loads fine. Also if we change the coords to anything else lower than that, like 0,0,0 32 is right on the limit of the scene. It seems this value used to be tolerated before, but not anymore in 6.6.3 for some reason. When the spawn point is outside the scene limits, the preview gets stuck without loading. Besides fixing this so that it's consistent with older versions, it's super important that we communicate an error message to console when this problem happens, right now there's no clue at all\", \"Smart items don't work on Builder This Builder scene has smart items that don't work properly when running the preview in the Builder or the CLI (This is different form #373 because this issue is visible in preview mode, that other one is only visible in-world once deployed, so I suspect it's caused by something different) At some point, you put a trigger area and it doesn’t work You go into preview and the trigger area remains orange, no matter what you do… hard reload, remove it and add another, configure it differently, etc (import this scene into the Builder, or ask me for the .zip file w all the scene to try it on the CLI, too large to attach) [https://app.zenhub.com/files/220994476/65e62b1b-3834-46f1-b53e-9a9acf393b90/download](https://app.zenhub.com/files/220994476/65e62b1b-3834-46f1-b53e-9a9acf393b90/download) You can see in this scene that the trigger area going up the ramp is always visible as an orange cube when running preview (should be invisible) and there's nothing you can do to fix it. The scene creator reports that he experiences this same bug differently on his side: when running the preview the trigger area isn't visible (correct behavior), but when triggering it, the whole of the smart item logic in the scene breaks for all other smart items and nothing is responsive. As a side note: Something very similar happened to me when creating the Christmas scene, I'm assuming it's related because it sounds very similar. I went through the same two versions of the issue with a same item. There was a lever that broke the whole scene when activated. In a first stage of the bug, whenever I activated the lever in the Builder preview, all other smart items ceased to work. In fact, if I returned to edit mode I couldn't even configure any of them anymore till I did a hard reload. Then after that, the issue mutated into its second stage (not sure at what point) and suddenly the invisible walls that were supposed to be activated and deactivated by this lever remained visible when running a preview. It was strange that if I tried this same lever activating and deactivating the same invisible wall in a new blank scene it worked well, it was not the fault of the smart item's code. Even though I saved a broken version of the scene for showing the bug in the future, if I test it today the scene appears to no longer be broken. I don't know what caused the bug to mutate from stage 1 to 2, or what fixed it in the end. But I tried a million different things in between. I tend to think that what changed between stage 1 and 2 is that I exported it and then re-imported it into the Builder. (import this scene into the Builder, or ask me for the .zip file w all the scene to try it on the CLI, too large to attach) [https://app.zenhub.com/files/220994476/f95da6e1-a073-4bb2-bcf0-f9b2bd221f1c/download](https://app.zenhub.com/files/220994476/f95da6e1-a073-4bb2-bcf0-f9b2bd221f1c/download)\"]"

However both memes disappeared with no trace after their transactions were both successful. #### Expected behavior [comment]: # (Describe what you expected to happen.) Expected memes to appear in challenge tab. #### Actual behavior [comment]: # (Describe what actually happened.) Memes disappeared. ### Reproduction [comment]: # (Describe how we can replicate the bug step by step.) - Open webapp - Select a properly formatted meme (file size, proportions) - Fill out information about meme - Submit Meme - Wait for transaction to clear - Observe the meme is nowhere to be found ### Solution [comment]: # (Please summarise the solution and provide a task list on what needs to be fixed.) *Summary*: - The meme needs to appear in the challenge tab. ### Additional Information [comment]: # (Please do your best to fill this out.) - browser console logs: ... [comment]: # (browser version) - Browser: Chrome #### Logs [comment]: # (if any sentry logs connected please paste links here) Meme tx 1: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x255f84802c30337754122c0fa1d9ec6f267fc39a41ff1ca5e5886199fa551923 Meme tx 2: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x4716b2e8868af0c20ef0ae65df7d2d200f2d2a9ede4166fecc14899e3eb291b6']"

The bug is that I still get the \"need to invoke from the root \\'kelp\\' directory\" error when trying to build the project on the Git Bash console on my windows computer. ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior is to be able to build the program with the bash console that is packaged with Git ## Frequency The frequency is always ## Steps To Reproduce Here are the steps to reproduce the issue (see attachments in section below): 1. On a windows 10 machine download git and include the git bash console 2. Follow the build from source instructions on the readme with the bash console 3. When you I try `./scripts/build.sh` the script exits with the message \"need to invoke from the root \\'kelp\\' directory\" even though I have already moved into the \\'kelp\\' directory per the instructions. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37156131/63181896-d2cd6380-c016-11e9-9f52-ba93f9af8ba5.png) ## Possible Solution After some research ([Git bash doesn\\'t recognize \\'rev\\' command](https://stackoverflow.com/q/55937274/5477004)), it appears that \"rev is an external command (a separate executable), not part of the shell itself; it\\'s thus not part of any version of bash, but something that exists (or doesn\\'t) depending on whether your it\\'s been separately installed (or included with your operating system &c)\". As mentioned [Issue#14 comment](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/issues/14#issuecomment-426487056) the problem is in the line `pwd | rev | cut -d\\'/\\' -f1 | rev` which can be rewritten as either ([more research](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1744613/5477004)) ```$(basename $(\"pwd\"))``` or ```pwd | sed \\'s#.*/##\\'``` Both have worked on my system and I have little linux experience to known whether either will cause issues in other environments. With that being said, my preference is for the first solution as I find it more readable. ## Your Environment When successfully run my environment is: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37156131/63181986-04462f00-c017-11e9-8c8f-64c17f21561a.png) ## Context As a predominantly windows user, I have found the git bash console to be the easiest one to use out of the box and is the most user friendly for those unfamiliar with unix. In order to clone the kelp repo, most users will already have git installed and likely already have this console. As such and baring integration issues with other systems, it makes sense to to try to restrict the bash scripts to commands that are native to bash whenever possible. ## Attachments']"

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3. Trade happens, which removes the open offer 4. We load offers and **see no open offers**. Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1. On centralized exchanges, there is no atomic way by which we can do both: load offers and trades a. this is not an issue with SDEX because this can be done atomically 2. We have currently implemented fill tracking as a separate thread and cannot exactly predict when it will run the fill trackers; *this needs to be made more predictable* This bug can be fixed by: - [x] introduce a new config entry in trader.cfg: `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` and `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` - [x] fetch trades immediately after loading offers [somewhere here](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/trader/trader.go#L169). - [x] add checks to ensure atomicity of (offers, balances, trades): load offers and balances, load trades, reload offers and balances -- if both results of loading offers (and balances) are the same then it means nothing has changed during this window, otherwise reload trades and then reload offers (and balances) and recheck. If this fails `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` times then crash bot. - [x] update documentation so that it is clear that you do not need to set `FILL_TRACKER_SLEEP_MILLIS` to fetch trades and can use `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` instead, which is a cheaper and more consistent alternative - there is a valid use case to still want to track fills every X seconds in addition to using the new config (such as the mirror strategy). Strategies such as the balanced strategy could switch over to using this new field though. - [x] [remove this line in sample_trader.cfg](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/examples/configs/trader/sample_trader.cfg#L37) since fill tracking is supported in non-SDEX exchanges - [x] testing ## Your Environment cli version: master:nightly-33ab2afe-17-g8f927d83 gui version: v1.0.0-rc1 git branch: master git hash: 8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635 build date: 20200723T104331Z env: dev GOOS: linux GOARCH: amd64 ## Context I am unable to reliably run a trading strategy that depends on having consistent trade data because of this. relates to #306 and can be a possible solution.

Otherwise, if the book moved more than 5% we get insufficient funds.

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3. Trade happens, which removes the open offer 4. We load offers and **see no open offers**. Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1. On centralized exchanges, there is no atomic way by which we can do both: load offers and trades a. this is not an issue with SDEX because this can be done atomically 2. We have currently implemented fill tracking as a separate thread and cannot exactly predict when it will run the fill trackers; *this needs to be made more predictable* This bug can be fixed by: - [x] introduce a new config entry in trader.cfg: `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` and `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` - [x] fetch trades immediately after loading offers [somewhere here](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/trader/trader.go#L169). - [x] add checks to ensure atomicity of (offers, balances, trades): load offers and balances, load trades, reload offers and balances -- if both results of loading offers (and balances) are the same then it means nothing has changed during this window, otherwise reload trades and then reload offers (and balances) and recheck. If this fails `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` times then crash bot. - [x] update documentation so that it is clear that you do not need to set `FILL_TRACKER_SLEEP_MILLIS` to fetch trades and can use `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` instead, which is a cheaper and more consistent alternative - there is a valid use case to still want to track fills every X seconds in addition to using the new config (such as the mirror strategy). Strategies such as the balanced strategy could switch over to using this new field though. - [x] [remove this line in sample_trader.cfg](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/examples/configs/trader/sample_trader.cfg#L37) since fill tracking is supported in non-SDEX exchanges - [x] testing ## Your Environment cli version: master:nightly-33ab2afe-17-g8f927d83 gui version: v1.0.0-rc1 git branch: master git hash: 8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635 build date: 20200723T104331Z env: dev GOOS: linux GOARCH: amd64 ## Context I am unable to reliably run a trading strategy that depends on having consistent trade data because of this. relates to #306 and can be a possible solution.

connecting to the backend & not running Tor. I have had the same problem in the last few weeks and I really tried to solve the issue. I have found a lot of different suggestions on Reddit and I thought it would be helpful to summarize them in one thread on Git. I'll also let you know what worked for me. **Problem:** Wasabi always worked perfectly fine for me. Suddenly it stopped working, Wallet didn't run Tor anymore and for that reason I wasn't able to send transactions, set fees, CoinJoin etc. In the Log File I received this error messages: `2020-05-23 21:08:30 INFO TorProcessManager (294) Tor did not work properly for 364 seconds. Maybe it crashed. Attempting to start it... 2020-05-23 21:08:31 INFO TorProcessManager (105) Updating Tor... 2020-05-23 21:08:32 INFO TorProcessManager (176) Extracted C:\\\\Program Files\\\\WasabiWallet\\\\TorDaemons\\\\data-folder.zip to C:\\\\Users\\\\XXXX\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\WalletWasabi\\\\Client\\\\tor. 2020-05-23 21:08:32 INFO TorProcessManager (182) Extracted C:\\\\Program Files\\\\WasabiWallet\\\\TorDaemons\\\\tor-win32.zip to C:\\\\Users\\\\XXXX\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\WalletWasabi\\\\Client\\\\tor. 2020-05-23 21:08:32 INFO TorProcessManager (139) Starting Tor process with Process.Start. 2020-05-23 21:08:36 ERROR TorProcessManager (165) WalletWasabi.Exceptions.TorException: Could not automatically start Tor.

Is the log similar to the one above? Congrats, you probably have the same issue as me. - Open the Tor Logs under **File > Open > Tor Log File** and check if you can find something interesting there. I had only Logs from the last time Wasabi worked properly. - Open Tor Browser and check if it works on .com and .onion sites. Despite it worked fine for me, I re-installed it and Wasabi worked for one evening but stopped working the next day - same issue again. After re-installing it you should first open Tor and then Wasabi Wallet - Turn Tor off under **Tools > Settings > Tor**, restart Wasabi, turn Tor on again and restart Wasabi. - Go to **C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\User\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Roaming\\\\\\\\tor\\\\\\\\** on Windows and delete the **cached-microdesc-consensus** file. Restart Wasabi and reboot the OS. - Uninstall Wasabi, delete the Tor folder and the WalletWasabi Folder under **C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\User\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Roaming\\\\\\\\** and install Wasabi Wallet again. **MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR RECOVERY SEED + PASSWORD!!!** **- FINAL SOLUTION FOR ME:** 1. Go to **Tools > Settings > Tor > Tor SOCKS5 Endpoint** and put a 1 behind the 9 instead of the 0 so it says :9150 as Port. 2. Run Tor Browser 3. Run Wasabi Wallet Then you have to wait a few minutes after everything is installed.\"]",

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3. Trade happens, which removes the open offer 4. We load offers and **see no open offers**. Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1. On centralized exchanges, there is no atomic way by which we can do both: load offers and trades a. this is not an issue with SDEX because this can be done atomically 2. We have currently implemented fill tracking as a separate thread and cannot exactly predict when it will run the fill trackers; *this needs to be made more predictable* This bug can be fixed by: - [x] introduce a new config entry in trader.cfg: `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` and `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` - [x] fetch trades immediately after loading offers [somewhere here](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/trader/trader.go#L169). - [x] add checks to ensure atomicity of (offers, balances, trades): load offers and balances, load trades, reload offers and balances -- if both results of loading offers (and balances) are the same then it means nothing has changed during this window, otherwise reload trades and then reload offers (and balances) and recheck. If this fails `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` times then crash bot. - [x] update documentation so that it is clear that you do not need to set `FILL_TRACKER_SLEEP_MILLIS` to fetch trades and can use `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` instead, which is a cheaper and more consistent alternative - there is a valid use case to still want to track fills every X seconds in addition to using the new config (such as the mirror strategy).

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3. Trade happens, which removes the open offer 4. We load offers and **see no open offers**. Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1. On centralized exchanges, there is no atomic way by which we can do both: load offers and trades a. this is not an issue with SDEX because this can be done atomically 2. We have currently implemented fill tracking as a separate thread and cannot exactly predict when it will run the fill trackers; *this needs to be made more predictable* This bug can be fixed by: - [x] introduce a new config entry in trader.cfg: `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` and `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` - [x] fetch trades immediately after loading offers [somewhere here](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/trader/trader.go#L169). - [x] add checks to ensure atomicity of (offers, balances, trades): load offers and balances, load trades, reload offers and balances -- if both results of loading offers (and balances) are the same then it means nothing has changed during this window, otherwise reload trades and then reload offers (and balances) and recheck. If this fails `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` times then crash bot. - [x] update documentation so that it is clear that you do not need to set `FILL_TRACKER_SLEEP_MILLIS` to fetch trades and can use `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` instead, which is a cheaper and more consistent alternative - there is a valid use case to still want to track fills every X seconds in addition to using the new config (such as the mirror strategy). Strategies such as the balanced strategy could switch over to using this new field though. - [x] [remove this line in sample_trader.cfg](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/examples/configs/trader/sample_trader.cfg#L37) since fill tracking is supported in non-SDEX exchanges - [x] testing ## Your Environment cli version: master:nightly-33ab2afe-17-g8f927d83 gui version: v1.0.0-rc1 git branch: master git hash: 8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635 build date: 20200723T104331Z env: dev GOOS: linux GOARCH: amd64 ## Context I am unable to reliably run a trading strategy that depends on having consistent trade data because of this. relates to #306 and can be a possible solution.

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3. Trade happens, which removes the open offer 4. We load offers and **see no open offers**. Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1. On centralized exchanges, there is no atomic way by which we can do both: load offers and trades a. this is not an issue with SDEX because this can be done atomically 2. We have currently implemented fill tracking as a separate thread and cannot exactly predict when it will run the fill trackers; *this needs to be made more predictable* This bug can be fixed by: - [x] introduce a new config entry in trader.cfg: `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` and `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` - [x] fetch trades immediately after loading offers [somewhere here](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/trader/trader.go#L169). - [x] add checks to ensure atomicity of (offers, balances, trades): load offers and balances, load trades, reload offers and balances -- if both results of loading offers (and balances) are the same then it means nothing has changed during this window, otherwise reload trades and then reload offers (and balances) and recheck. If this fails `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` times then crash bot. - [x] update documentation so that it is clear that you do not need to set `FILL_TRACKER_SLEEP_MILLIS` to fetch trades and can use `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` instead, which is a cheaper and more consistent alternative - there is a valid use case to still want to track fills every X seconds in addition to using the new config (such as the mirror strategy).

This skews the profitability calculation on individual roundtrips. This is relevant to me as I have other hacks to calculate and display the number of profitable roundtrips, and the average profit/loss for all roundtrips, which I think are useful stats. The roundtrip exit value is calculated correctly. My local fix for this is to use the portfolio balance for the entry point, and in the paper trader set the balance equal to the total currency before simulating the 'buy'",

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3. Trade happens, which removes the open offer 4. We load offers and **see no open offers**. Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1. On centralized exchanges, there is no atomic way by which we can do both: load offers and trades a. this is not an issue with SDEX because this can be done atomically 2. We have currently implemented fill tracking as a separate thread and cannot exactly predict when it will run the fill trackers; *this needs to be made more predictable* This bug can be fixed by: - [x] introduce a new config entry in trader.cfg: `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` and `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` - [x] fetch trades immediately after loading offers [somewhere here](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/trader/trader.go#L169). - [x] add checks to ensure atomicity of (offers, balances, trades): load offers and balances, load trades, reload offers and balances -- if both results of loading offers (and balances) are the same then it means nothing has changed during this window, otherwise reload trades and then reload offers (and balances) and recheck. If this fails `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` times then crash bot. - [x] update documentation so that it is clear that you do not need to set `FILL_TRACKER_SLEEP_MILLIS` to fetch trades and can use `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` instead, which is a cheaper and more consistent alternative - there is a valid use case to still want to track fills every X seconds in addition to using the new config (such as the mirror strategy). Strategies such as the balanced strategy could switch over to using this new field though. - [x] [remove this line in sample_trader.cfg](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/examples/configs/trader/sample_trader.cfg#L37) since fill tracking is supported in non-SDEX exchanges - [x] testing ## Your Environment cli version: master:nightly-33ab2afe-17-g8f927d83 gui version: v1.0.0-rc1 git branch: master git hash: 8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635 build date: 20200723T104331Z env: dev GOOS: linux GOARCH: amd64 ## Context I am unable to reliably run a trading strategy that depends on having consistent trade data because of this. relates to #306 and can be a possible solution.

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3.

Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1.

         "[\"Fix policy condition calculation ### Description When constructing the `Condition` struct we recursively call `get_condition` on all the items in a threshold and short-circuit if there's an error somewhere (for example, because the policy-path hasn't been provided for a specific threshold). This can cause issues when the user doesn't care about a subtree, because we still try to call `get_condition` on all the items and fail if something is missing, even if the specific subtree isn't selected and won't be used later on. This commit changes the logic so that we first filter only the `selected` items, and then unwrap the error using the question mark. If errors happened somewhere else they will be ignored, as they should. ### Notes to the reviewers I think it makes sense to backport this to `0.27`: even though it's not a critical issue (and there's a workaround[^1] for the bug) it may be a while before the new `1.0` is released. I wouldn't do a release just for this, but I would just leave it there and maybe in a few weeks if there are other fixes to be backported to pre-1.0 they could all be released. ### Changelog notice - Fixed a bug in the policy condition calculation ### Checklists #### All Submissions: * [x] I've signed all my commits * [x] I followed the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) * [x] I ran `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before committing #### New Features: * [ ] I've added tests for the new feature * [ ] I've added docs for the new feature #### Bugfixes: * [ ] This pull request breaks the existing API * [x] I've added tests to reproduce the issue which are now passing * [ ] I'm linking the issue being fixed by this PR [^1]: The workaround is to simply set the items in the policy tree even if they won't be used. For example, if the item causing troubles is a `thresh(1, ...)` just set `[0]` in the policy path for that id.\", 'Uniswap \"Connect Smart Wallet\" On Mac OS Failure Error **Bug Description** When trying to connect any smart wallet to Uniswap on Mac OS, a fatal error occurs and a \"Try again\" button appears immediately, and cannot progress past this. This bug got progressively worse, noticed about 7pm PCT. Prior, the wallet would connect and the transaction would be confirmed in the wallet, however the transaction would stay \"Pending\" with no progress. You could manually confirm the transaction multiple times in V1 of uniswap, however no progress will be made. As of now on Mac OS I cannot connect a smart wallet to either uniswap version. **Steps to Reproduce** 1. Go to Connect Wallet 2. Click on Wallet Connect option 3. The error should appear and no refresh will help the page move and function normally. ... **Expected Behavior** After clicking connect smart wallet from the wallet options, the window will open and close right away telling you to try again. No attempt can made to actually try to connect. No QR code will appear, only a \"try again\" button. **Additional Context** Uniswap seems to have trouble communicating with smart wallets at this time. As prior to this, it was connecting and working as expected. Within hours, it would connect, but bug out, and not complete transactions, regardless of approval of contract, or auto approval, despite there being sufficient funds.', '\"You need to select more coins!\" when editing a \"speed up\" transaction **Describe the bug** The \"Speed up\" button allows to \"Fully edit the transaction\", which is great when there\\'s no change output (#988), but it fails to create the new transaction. It\\'s probably because the inputs of the original transaction are considered spent, and thus don\\'t appear in the coin selection list. **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. Have an unconfirmed transaction in a wallet 2. Click on \\'Speed up\\' 3. Enter the new fee rate 4. Click on \"Advanced\" and \"Fully edit the transaction\" 5. Notice the inputs of the original transaction don\\'t appear in the coin selection table 6. Click on \"Create the unsigned transaction\" 7. It says \"You need to select more coins!\" **Expected behavior** - Either the new transaction should be created with the new fee rate and the same inputs, - or the UI should allow the selection of the same inputs as in the replaced transaction **Desktop:** - Where is your node running: local(internal) - Where is your specter running: binary - If you\\'re running a binary, which OS: Linux - Browser: electron - Specter Version: tested on 2.0.0, 2.0.1, and 2.0.2pre6 **Additional context** It seems the code checks if there\\'s enough coins selected by looking at the selected rows whereas there\\'s no row for the spent outputs.

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3. Trade happens, which removes the open offer 4. We load offers and **see no open offers**. Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1. On centralized exchanges, there is no atomic way by which we can do both: load offers and trades a. this is not an issue with SDEX because this can be done atomically 2.

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3. Trade happens, which removes the open offer 4. We load offers and **see no open offers**. Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1. On centralized exchanges, there is no atomic way by which we can do both: load offers and trades a. this is not an issue with SDEX because this can be done atomically 2. We have currently implemented fill tracking as a separate thread and cannot exactly predict when it will run the fill trackers; *this needs to be made more predictable* This bug can be fixed by: - [x] introduce a new config entry in trader.cfg: `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` and `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` - [x] fetch trades immediately after loading offers [somewhere here](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/trader/trader.go#L169). - [x] add checks to ensure atomicity of (offers, balances, trades): load offers and balances, load trades, reload offers and balances -- if both results of loading offers (and balances) are the same then it means nothing has changed during this window, otherwise reload trades and then reload offers (and balances) and recheck. If this fails `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` times then crash bot. - [x] update documentation so that it is clear that you do not need to set `FILL_TRACKER_SLEEP_MILLIS` to fetch trades and can use `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` instead, which is a cheaper and more consistent alternative - there is a valid use case to still want to track fills every X seconds in addition to using the new config (such as the mirror strategy).

         "[\"Fix policy condition calculation ### Description When constructing the `Condition` struct we recursively call `get_condition` on all the items in a threshold and short-circuit if there's an error somewhere (for example, because the policy-path hasn't been provided for a specific threshold). This can cause issues when the user doesn't care about a subtree, because we still try to call `get_condition` on all the items and fail if something is missing, even if the specific subtree isn't selected and won't be used later on. This commit changes the logic so that we first filter only the `selected` items, and then unwrap the error using the question mark. If errors happened somewhere else they will be ignored, as they should. ### Notes to the reviewers I think it makes sense to backport this to `0.27`: even though it's not a critical issue (and there's a workaround[^1] for the bug) it may be a while before the new `1.0` is released. I wouldn't do a release just for this, but I would just leave it there and maybe in a few weeks if there are other fixes to be backported to pre-1.0 they could all be released. ### Changelog notice - Fixed a bug in the policy condition calculation ### Checklists #### All Submissions: * [x] I've signed all my commits * [x] I followed the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) * [x] I ran `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before committing #### New Features: * [ ] I've added tests for the new feature * [ ] I've added docs for the new feature #### Bugfixes: * [ ] This pull request breaks the existing API * [x] I've added tests to reproduce the issue which are now passing * [ ] I'm linking the issue being fixed by this PR [^1]: The workaround is to simply set the items in the policy tree even if they won't be used. For example, if the item causing troubles is a `thresh(1, ...)` just set `[0]` in the policy path for that id.\", 'Uniswap \"Connect Smart Wallet\" On Mac OS Failure Error **Bug Description** When trying to connect any smart wallet to Uniswap on Mac OS, a fatal error occurs and a \"Try again\" button appears immediately, and cannot progress past this. This bug got progressively worse, noticed about 7pm PCT. Prior, the wallet would connect and the transaction would be confirmed in the wallet, however the transaction would stay \"Pending\" with no progress. You could manually confirm the transaction multiple times in V1 of uniswap, however no progress will be made. As of now on Mac OS I cannot connect a smart wallet to either uniswap version. **Steps to Reproduce** 1. Go to Connect Wallet 2. Click on Wallet Connect option 3. The error should appear and no refresh will help the page move and function normally. ... **Expected Behavior** After clicking connect smart wallet from the wallet options, the window will open and close right away telling you to try again. No attempt can made to actually try to connect. No QR code will appear, only a \"try again\" button. **Additional Context** Uniswap seems to have trouble communicating with smart wallets at this time. As prior to this, it was connecting and working as expected. Within hours, it would connect, but bug out, and not complete transactions, regardless of approval of contract, or auto approval, despite there being sufficient funds.', '\"You need to select more coins!\" when editing a \"speed up\" transaction **Describe the bug** The \"Speed up\" button allows to \"Fully edit the transaction\", which is great when there\\'s no change output (#988), but it fails to create the new transaction. It\\'s probably because the inputs of the original transaction are considered spent, and thus don\\'t appear in the coin selection list. **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. Have an unconfirmed transaction in a wallet 2. Click on \\'Speed up\\' 3. Enter the new fee rate 4. Click on \"Advanced\" and \"Fully edit the transaction\" 5. Notice the inputs of the original transaction don\\'t appear in the coin selection table 6. Click on \"Create the unsigned transaction\" 7. It says \"You need to select more coins!\" **Expected behavior** - Either the new transaction should be created with the new fee rate and the same inputs, - or the UI should allow the selection of the same inputs as in the replaced transaction **Desktop:** - Where is your node running: local(internal) - Where is your specter running: binary - If you\\'re running a binary, which OS: Linux - Browser: electron - Specter Version: tested on 2.0.0, 2.0.1, and 2.0.2pre6 **Additional context** It seems the code checks if there\\'s enough coins selected by looking at the selected rows whereas there\\'s no row for the spent outputs.

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3. Trade happens, which removes the open offer 4. We load offers and **see no open offers**. Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1. On centralized exchanges, there is no atomic way by which we can do both: load offers and trades a. this is not an issue with SDEX because this can be done atomically 2. We have currently implemented fill tracking as a separate thread and cannot exactly predict when it will run the fill trackers; *this needs to be made more predictable* This bug can be fixed by: - [x] introduce a new config entry in trader.cfg: `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` and `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` - [x] fetch trades immediately after loading offers [somewhere here](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/trader/trader.go#L169). - [x] add checks to ensure atomicity of (offers, balances, trades): load offers and balances, load trades, reload offers and balances -- if both results of loading offers (and balances) are the same then it means nothing has changed during this window, otherwise reload trades and then reload offers (and balances) and recheck. If this fails `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` times then crash bot. - [x] update documentation so that it is clear that you do not need to set `FILL_TRACKER_SLEEP_MILLIS` to fetch trades and can use `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` instead, which is a cheaper and more consistent alternative - there is a valid use case to still want to track fills every X seconds in addition to using the new config (such as the mirror strategy). Strategies such as the balanced strategy could switch over to using this new field though. - [x] [remove this line in sample_trader.cfg](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/examples/configs/trader/sample_trader.cfg#L37) since fill tracking is supported in non-SDEX exchanges - [x] testing ## Your Environment cli version: master:nightly-33ab2afe-17-g8f927d83 gui version: v1.0.0-rc1 git branch: master git hash: 8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635 build date: 20200723T104331Z env: dev GOOS: linux GOARCH: amd64 ## Context I am unable to reliably run a trading strategy that depends on having consistent trade data because of this. relates to #306 and can be a possible solution.

         "[\"Fix policy condition calculation ### Description When constructing the `Condition` struct we recursively call `get_condition` on all the items in a threshold and short-circuit if there's an error somewhere (for example, because the policy-path hasn't been provided for a specific threshold). This can cause issues when the user doesn't care about a subtree, because we still try to call `get_condition` on all the items and fail if something is missing, even if the specific subtree isn't selected and won't be used later on. This commit changes the logic so that we first filter only the `selected` items, and then unwrap the error using the question mark. If errors happened somewhere else they will be ignored, as they should. ### Notes to the reviewers I think it makes sense to backport this to `0.27`: even though it's not a critical issue (and there's a workaround[^1] for the bug) it may be a while before the new `1.0` is released. I wouldn't do a release just for this, but I would just leave it there and maybe in a few weeks if there are other fixes to be backported to pre-1.0 they could all be released. ### Changelog notice - Fixed a bug in the policy condition calculation ### Checklists #### All Submissions: * [x] I've signed all my commits * [x] I followed the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) * [x] I ran `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before committing #### New Features: * [ ] I've added tests for the new feature * [ ] I've added docs for the new feature #### Bugfixes: * [ ] This pull request breaks the existing API * [x] I've added tests to reproduce the issue which are now passing * [ ] I'm linking the issue being fixed by this PR [^1]: The workaround is to simply set the items in the policy tree even if they won't be used.

This bug got progressively worse, noticed about 7pm PCT. Prior, the wallet would connect and the transaction would be confirmed in the wallet, however the transaction would stay \"Pending\" with no progress. You could manually confirm the transaction multiple times in V1 of uniswap, however no progress will be made. As of now on Mac OS I cannot connect a smart wallet to either uniswap version. **Steps to Reproduce** 1. Go to Connect Wallet 2. Click on Wallet Connect option 3. The error should appear and no refresh will help the page move and function normally. ... **Expected Behavior** After clicking connect smart wallet from the wallet options, the window will open and close right away telling you to try again. No attempt can made to actually try to connect. No QR code will appear, only a \"try again\" button. **Additional Context** Uniswap seems to have trouble communicating with smart wallets at this time. As prior to this, it was connecting and working as expected. Within hours, it would connect, but bug out, and not complete transactions, regardless of approval of contract, or auto approval, despite there being sufficient funds.', '\"You need to select more coins!\" when editing a \"speed up\" transaction **Describe the bug** The \"Speed up\" button allows to \"Fully edit the transaction\", which is great when there\\'s no change output (#988), but it fails to create the new transaction. It\\'s probably because the inputs of the original transaction are considered spent, and thus don\\'t appear in the coin selection list. **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. Have an unconfirmed transaction in a wallet 2. Click on \\'Speed up\\' 3. Enter the new fee rate 4. Click on \"Advanced\" and \"Fully edit the transaction\" 5. Notice the inputs of the original transaction don\\'t appear in the coin selection table 6. Click on \"Create the unsigned transaction\" 7. It says \"You need to select more coins!\" **Expected behavior** - Either the new transaction should be created with the new fee rate and the same inputs, - or the UI should allow the selection of the same inputs as in the replaced transaction **Desktop:** - Where is your node running: local(internal) - Where is your specter running: binary - If you\\'re running a binary, which OS: Linux - Browser: electron - Specter Version: tested on 2.0.0, 2.0.1, and 2.0.2pre6 **Additional context** It seems the code checks if there\\'s enough coins selected by looking at the selected rows whereas there\\'s no row for the spent outputs.

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3. Trade happens, which removes the open offer 4. We load offers and **see no open offers**. Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1.

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3. Trade happens, which removes the open offer 4. We load offers and **see no open offers**. Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1. On centralized exchanges, there is no atomic way by which we can do both: load offers and trades a. this is not an issue with SDEX because this can be done atomically 2. We have currently implemented fill tracking as a separate thread and cannot exactly predict when it will run the fill trackers; *this needs to be made more predictable* This bug can be fixed by: - [x] introduce a new config entry in trader.cfg: `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` and `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` - [x] fetch trades immediately after loading offers [somewhere here](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/trader/trader.go#L169). - [x] add checks to ensure atomicity of (offers, balances, trades): load offers and balances, load trades, reload offers and balances -- if both results of loading offers (and balances) are the same then it means nothing has changed during this window, otherwise reload trades and then reload offers (and balances) and recheck. If this fails `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` times then crash bot. - [x] update documentation so that it is clear that you do not need to set `FILL_TRACKER_SLEEP_MILLIS` to fetch trades and can use `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` instead, which is a cheaper and more consistent alternative - there is a valid use case to still want to track fills every X seconds in addition to using the new config (such as the mirror strategy).

After some investigation I realized that my server is acting as being DoSed, but in reality it was not my server under attack but the attacker. It problem was Gekko. I had running 28 different CLI gekkos to grab data from Stamp, Finex, Okcoin, Polo and Kraken. Everything worked nicely for more then 6 months. Few days ago, finex removed BFX pairs so they started returning error that wasn't handled by script (it kept trying to get data). Obviously finex reported bad requests to cloudflare who refused all requests from my server and as a countermeasure they didn't close the connections (thus the impression my server is under attack). All this resulted in server crash and ban from cloudflare. Before I restart grabbing we should definitely introduce some better error handling (status in UI, email on critical errors, ...). So, stay nice to cloudflare! T.",

         "[\"Fix policy condition calculation ### Description When constructing the `Condition` struct we recursively call `get_condition` on all the items in a threshold and short-circuit if there's an error somewhere (for example, because the policy-path hasn't been provided for a specific threshold). This can cause issues when the user doesn't care about a subtree, because we still try to call `get_condition` on all the items and fail if something is missing, even if the specific subtree isn't selected and won't be used later on. This commit changes the logic so that we first filter only the `selected` items, and then unwrap the error using the question mark. If errors happened somewhere else they will be ignored, as they should. ### Notes to the reviewers I think it makes sense to backport this to `0.27`: even though it's not a critical issue (and there's a workaround[^1] for the bug) it may be a while before the new `1.0` is released. I wouldn't do a release just for this, but I would just leave it there and maybe in a few weeks if there are other fixes to be backported to pre-1.0 they could all be released. ### Changelog notice - Fixed a bug in the policy condition calculation ### Checklists #### All Submissions: * [x] I've signed all my commits * [x] I followed the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) * [x] I ran `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before committing #### New Features: * [ ] I've added tests for the new feature * [ ] I've added docs for the new feature #### Bugfixes: * [ ] This pull request breaks the existing API * [x] I've added tests to reproduce the issue which are now passing * [ ] I'm linking the issue being fixed by this PR [^1]: The workaround is to simply set the items in the policy tree even if they won't be used. For example, if the item causing troubles is a `thresh(1, ...)` just set `[0]` in the policy path for that id.\", 'Uniswap \"Connect Smart Wallet\" On Mac OS Failure Error **Bug Description** When trying to connect any smart wallet to Uniswap on Mac OS, a fatal error occurs and a \"Try again\" button appears immediately, and cannot progress past this. This bug got progressively worse, noticed about 7pm PCT. Prior, the wallet would connect and the transaction would be confirmed in the wallet, however the transaction would stay \"Pending\" with no progress. You could manually confirm the transaction multiple times in V1 of uniswap, however no progress will be made. As of now on Mac OS I cannot connect a smart wallet to either uniswap version. **Steps to Reproduce** 1. Go to Connect Wallet 2. Click on Wallet Connect option 3. The error should appear and no refresh will help the page move and function normally. ... **Expected Behavior** After clicking connect smart wallet from the wallet options, the window will open and close right away telling you to try again. No attempt can made to actually try to connect. No QR code will appear, only a \"try again\" button. **Additional Context** Uniswap seems to have trouble communicating with smart wallets at this time. As prior to this, it was connecting and working as expected.

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3. Trade happens, which removes the open offer 4. We load offers and **see no open offers**. Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1. On centralized exchanges, there is no atomic way by which we can do both: load offers and trades a. this is not an issue with SDEX because this can be done atomically 2. We have currently implemented fill tracking as a separate thread and cannot exactly predict when it will run the fill trackers; *this needs to be made more predictable* This bug can be fixed by: - [x] introduce a new config entry in trader.cfg: `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` and `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` - [x] fetch trades immediately after loading offers [somewhere here](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/trader/trader.go#L169). - [x] add checks to ensure atomicity of (offers, balances, trades): load offers and balances, load trades, reload offers and balances -- if both results of loading offers (and balances) are the same then it means nothing has changed during this window, otherwise reload trades and then reload offers (and balances) and recheck. If this fails `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` times then crash bot. - [x] update documentation so that it is clear that you do not need to set `FILL_TRACKER_SLEEP_MILLIS` to fetch trades and can use `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` instead, which is a cheaper and more consistent alternative - there is a valid use case to still want to track fills every X seconds in addition to using the new config (such as the mirror strategy). Strategies such as the balanced strategy could switch over to using this new field though. - [x] [remove this line in sample_trader.cfg](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/examples/configs/trader/sample_trader.cfg#L37) since fill tracking is supported in non-SDEX exchanges - [x] testing ## Your Environment cli version: master:nightly-33ab2afe-17-g8f927d83 gui version: v1.0.0-rc1 git branch: master git hash: 8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635 build date: 20200723T104331Z env: dev GOOS: linux GOARCH: amd64 ## Context I am unable to reliably run a trading strategy that depends on having consistent trade data because of this. relates to #306 and can be a possible solution.

Steps to reproduce: - connect to LNC node - modify host to something unreachable - click \"save\" -> Zeus will reconnect to old host... The root cause was that serverHost was being stored in two places: within the main credentials object and as part of the persisted data. When loading credentials, the old serverHost value from persisted data was overriding the new host setting. -> Fixed this by separating serverHost storage into its own dedicated storage location and implementing proper migration to handle existing data.

         "[\"Fix policy condition calculation ### Description When constructing the `Condition` struct we recursively call `get_condition` on all the items in a threshold and short-circuit if there's an error somewhere (for example, because the policy-path hasn't been provided for a specific threshold). This can cause issues when the user doesn't care about a subtree, because we still try to call `get_condition` on all the items and fail if something is missing, even if the specific subtree isn't selected and won't be used later on. This commit changes the logic so that we first filter only the `selected` items, and then unwrap the error using the question mark. If errors happened somewhere else they will be ignored, as they should. ### Notes to the reviewers I think it makes sense to backport this to `0.27`: even though it's not a critical issue (and there's a workaround[^1] for the bug) it may be a while before the new `1.0` is released. I wouldn't do a release just for this, but I would just leave it there and maybe in a few weeks if there are other fixes to be backported to pre-1.0 they could all be released. ### Changelog notice - Fixed a bug in the policy condition calculation ### Checklists #### All Submissions: * [x] I've signed all my commits * [x] I followed the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) * [x] I ran `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before committing #### New Features: * [ ] I've added tests for the new feature * [ ] I've added docs for the new feature #### Bugfixes: * [ ] This pull request breaks the existing API * [x] I've added tests to reproduce the issue which are now passing * [ ] I'm linking the issue being fixed by this PR [^1]: The workaround is to simply set the items in the policy tree even if they won't be used.

This bug got progressively worse, noticed about 7pm PCT. Prior, the wallet would connect and the transaction would be confirmed in the wallet, however the transaction would stay \"Pending\" with no progress. You could manually confirm the transaction multiple times in V1 of uniswap, however no progress will be made. As of now on Mac OS I cannot connect a smart wallet to either uniswap version. **Steps to Reproduce** 1. Go to Connect Wallet 2. Click on Wallet Connect option 3. The error should appear and no refresh will help the page move and function normally. ... **Expected Behavior** After clicking connect smart wallet from the wallet options, the window will open and close right away telling you to try again. No attempt can made to actually try to connect. No QR code will appear, only a \"try again\" button. **Additional Context** Uniswap seems to have trouble communicating with smart wallets at this time. As prior to this, it was connecting and working as expected. Within hours, it would connect, but bug out, and not complete transactions, regardless of approval of contract, or auto approval, despite there being sufficient funds.', '\"You need to select more coins!\" when editing a \"speed up\" transaction **Describe the bug** The \"Speed up\" button allows to \"Fully edit the transaction\", which is great when there\\'s no change output (#988), but it fails to create the new transaction. It\\'s probably because the inputs of the original transaction are considered spent, and thus don\\'t appear in the coin selection list. **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. Have an unconfirmed transaction in a wallet 2. Click on \\'Speed up\\' 3. Enter the new fee rate 4. Click on \"Advanced\" and \"Fully edit the transaction\" 5. Notice the inputs of the original transaction don\\'t appear in the coin selection table 6. Click on \"Create the unsigned transaction\" 7. It says \"You need to select more coins!\" **Expected behavior** - Either the new transaction should be created with the new fee rate and the same inputs, - or the UI should allow the selection of the same inputs as in the replaced transaction **Desktop:** - Where is your node running: local(internal) - Where is your specter running: binary - If you\\'re running a binary, which OS: Linux - Browser: electron - Specter Version: tested on 2.0.0, 2.0.1, and 2.0.2pre6 **Additional context** It seems the code checks if there\\'s enough coins selected by looking at the selected rows whereas there\\'s no row for the spent outputs.

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3. Trade happens, which removes the open offer 4. We load offers and **see no open offers**. Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1. On centralized exchanges, there is no atomic way by which we can do both: load offers and trades a. this is not an issue with SDEX because this can be done atomically 2. We have currently implemented fill tracking as a separate thread and cannot exactly predict when it will run the fill trackers; *this needs to be made more predictable* This bug can be fixed by: - [x] introduce a new config entry in trader.cfg: `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` and `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` - [x] fetch trades immediately after loading offers [somewhere here](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/trader/trader.go#L169). - [x] add checks to ensure atomicity of (offers, balances, trades): load offers and balances, load trades, reload offers and balances -- if both results of loading offers (and balances) are the same then it means nothing has changed during this window, otherwise reload trades and then reload offers (and balances) and recheck. If this fails `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` times then crash bot. - [x] update documentation so that it is clear that you do not need to set `FILL_TRACKER_SLEEP_MILLIS` to fetch trades and can use `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` instead, which is a cheaper and more consistent alternative - there is a valid use case to still want to track fills every X seconds in addition to using the new config (such as the mirror strategy).

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3. Trade happens, which removes the open offer 4. We load offers and **see no open offers**. Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1. On centralized exchanges, there is no atomic way by which we can do both: load offers and trades a. this is not an issue with SDEX because this can be done atomically 2. We have currently implemented fill tracking as a separate thread and cannot exactly predict when it will run the fill trackers; *this needs to be made more predictable* This bug can be fixed by: - [x] introduce a new config entry in trader.cfg: `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` and `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` - [x] fetch trades immediately after loading offers [somewhere here](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/trader/trader.go#L169). - [x] add checks to ensure atomicity of (offers, balances, trades): load offers and balances, load trades, reload offers and balances -- if both results of loading offers (and balances) are the same then it means nothing has changed during this window, otherwise reload trades and then reload offers (and balances) and recheck. If this fails `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` times then crash bot. - [x] update documentation so that it is clear that you do not need to set `FILL_TRACKER_SLEEP_MILLIS` to fetch trades and can use `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` instead, which is a cheaper and more consistent alternative - there is a valid use case to still want to track fills every X seconds in addition to using the new config (such as the mirror strategy). Strategies such as the balanced strategy could switch over to using this new field though. - [x] [remove this line in sample_trader.cfg](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/examples/configs/trader/sample_trader.cfg#L37) since fill tracking is supported in non-SDEX exchanges - [x] testing ## Your Environment cli version: master:nightly-33ab2afe-17-g8f927d83 gui version: v1.0.0-rc1 git branch: master git hash: 8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635 build date: 20200723T104331Z env: dev GOOS: linux GOARCH: amd64 ## Context I am unable to reliably run a trading strategy that depends on having consistent trade data because of this. relates to #306 and can be a possible solution.

connecting to the backend & not running Tor. I have had the same problem in the last few weeks and I really tried to solve the issue. I have found a lot of different suggestions on Reddit and I thought it would be helpful to summarize them in one thread on Git. I'll also let you know what worked for me. **Problem:** Wasabi always worked perfectly fine for me. Suddenly it stopped working, Wallet didn't run Tor anymore and for that reason I wasn't able to send transactions, set fees, CoinJoin etc. In the Log File I received this error messages: `2020-05-23 21:08:30 INFO TorProcessManager (294) Tor did not work properly for 364 seconds. Maybe it crashed. Attempting to start it... 2020-05-23 21:08:31 INFO TorProcessManager (105) Updating Tor... 2020-05-23 21:08:32 INFO TorProcessManager (176) Extracted C:\\\\Program Files\\\\WasabiWallet\\\\TorDaemons\\\\data-folder.zip to C:\\\\Users\\\\XXXX\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\WalletWasabi\\\\Client\\\\tor. 2020-05-23 21:08:32 INFO TorProcessManager (182) Extracted C:\\\\Program Files\\\\WasabiWallet\\\\TorDaemons\\\\tor-win32.zip to C:\\\\Users\\\\XXXX\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\WalletWasabi\\\\Client\\\\tor. 2020-05-23 21:08:32 INFO TorProcessManager (139) Starting Tor process with Process.Start. 2020-05-23 21:08:36 ERROR TorProcessManager (165) WalletWasabi.Exceptions.TorException: Could not automatically start Tor.

Is the log similar to the one above? Congrats, you probably have the same issue as me. - Open the Tor Logs under **File > Open > Tor Log File** and check if you can find something interesting there. I had only Logs from the last time Wasabi worked properly. - Open Tor Browser and check if it works on .com and .onion sites. Despite it worked fine for me, I re-installed it and Wasabi worked for one evening but stopped working the next day - same issue again. After re-installing it you should first open Tor and then Wasabi Wallet - Turn Tor off under **Tools > Settings > Tor**, restart Wasabi, turn Tor on again and restart Wasabi. - Go to **C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\User\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Roaming\\\\\\\\tor\\\\\\\\** on Windows and delete the **cached-microdesc-consensus** file. Restart Wasabi and reboot the OS. - Uninstall Wasabi, delete the Tor folder and the WalletWasabi Folder under **C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\User\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Roaming\\\\\\\\** and install Wasabi Wallet again. **MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR RECOVERY SEED + PASSWORD!!!** **- FINAL SOLUTION FOR ME:** 1. Go to **Tools > Settings > Tor > Tor SOCKS5 Endpoint** and put a 1 behind the 9 instead of the 0 so it says :9150 as Port. 2. Run Tor Browser 3. Run Wasabi Wallet Then you have to wait a few minutes after everything is installed.\"]",

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3. Trade happens, which removes the open offer 4. We load offers and **see no open offers**. Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1. On centralized exchanges, there is no atomic way by which we can do both: load offers and trades a. this is not an issue with SDEX because this can be done atomically 2. We have currently implemented fill tracking as a separate thread and cannot exactly predict when it will run the fill trackers; *this needs to be made more predictable* This bug can be fixed by: - [x] introduce a new config entry in trader.cfg: `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` and `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` - [x] fetch trades immediately after loading offers [somewhere here](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/trader/trader.go#L169). - [x] add checks to ensure atomicity of (offers, balances, trades): load offers and balances, load trades, reload offers and balances -- if both results of loading offers (and balances) are the same then it means nothing has changed during this window, otherwise reload trades and then reload offers (and balances) and recheck. If this fails `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` times then crash bot. - [x] update documentation so that it is clear that you do not need to set `FILL_TRACKER_SLEEP_MILLIS` to fetch trades and can use `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` instead, which is a cheaper and more consistent alternative - there is a valid use case to still want to track fills every X seconds in addition to using the new config (such as the mirror strategy). Strategies such as the balanced strategy could switch over to using this new field though. - [x] [remove this line in sample_trader.cfg](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/examples/configs/trader/sample_trader.cfg#L37) since fill tracking is supported in non-SDEX exchanges - [x] testing ## Your Environment cli version: master:nightly-33ab2afe-17-g8f927d83 gui version: v1.0.0-rc1 git branch: master git hash: 8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635 build date: 20200723T104331Z env: dev GOOS: linux GOARCH: amd64 ## Context I am unable to reliably run a trading strategy that depends on having consistent trade data because of this. relates to #306 and can be a possible solution.

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3. Trade happens, which removes the open offer 4. We load offers and **see no open offers**. Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1. On centralized exchanges, there is no atomic way by which we can do both: load offers and trades a. this is not an issue with SDEX because this can be done atomically 2. We have currently implemented fill tracking as a separate thread and cannot exactly predict when it will run the fill trackers; *this needs to be made more predictable* This bug can be fixed by: - [x] introduce a new config entry in trader.cfg: `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` and `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` - [x] fetch trades immediately after loading offers [somewhere here](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/trader/trader.go#L169). - [x] add checks to ensure atomicity of (offers, balances, trades): load offers and balances, load trades, reload offers and balances -- if both results of loading offers (and balances) are the same then it means nothing has changed during this window, otherwise reload trades and then reload offers (and balances) and recheck. If this fails `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` times then crash bot. - [x] update documentation so that it is clear that you do not need to set `FILL_TRACKER_SLEEP_MILLIS` to fetch trades and can use `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` instead, which is a cheaper and more consistent alternative - there is a valid use case to still want to track fills every X seconds in addition to using the new config (such as the mirror strategy).

The race condition only occurs on non-DEX exchanges but the solution will be cheaper on SDEX so went with the above title. ## Describe the bug The bot can end up in a situation where it has an offer consumed and cannot see the corresponding trade and therefore makes incorrect decisions. This is a *race condition* because it purely occurs only when the below (or similar) sequence occurs: 1. Bot places offer 2. Fill tracker checks for trades, **finds nothing** (correct) -- the fill tracker runs every X milliseconds. This is of course limited by the rate limit on the trading exchange. 3. Trade happens, which removes the open offer 4. We load offers and **see no open offers**. Bug: the trade is not registered with the fill tracker and the offer also does not show up ## Expected behavior I think the correct behavior in this situation is for the bot to do one of the two options: 1. show the open offer and not register the trade (because it has not occurred at some cutoff point) 1. not show the open offer and have the trade registered (because it has already occurred at some cutoff point) ## Frequency The frequency is: Unpredictable (but with a high enough frequency) ## Steps To Reproduce See above ## Possible Solution There are many issues with this: 1. On centralized exchanges, there is no atomic way by which we can do both: load offers and trades a. this is not an issue with SDEX because this can be done atomically 2. We have currently implemented fill tracking as a separate thread and cannot exactly predict when it will run the fill trackers; *this needs to be made more predictable* This bug can be fixed by: - [x] introduce a new config entry in trader.cfg: `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` and `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` - [x] fetch trades immediately after loading offers [somewhere here](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/trader/trader.go#L169). - [x] add checks to ensure atomicity of (offers, balances, trades): load offers and balances, load trades, reload offers and balances -- if both results of loading offers (and balances) are the same then it means nothing has changed during this window, otherwise reload trades and then reload offers (and balances) and recheck. If this fails `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_MAX_RETRIES` times then crash bot. - [x] update documentation so that it is clear that you do not need to set `FILL_TRACKER_SLEEP_MILLIS` to fetch trades and can use `SYNCHRONIZE_STATE_LOAD_ENABLE` instead, which is a cheaper and more consistent alternative - there is a valid use case to still want to track fills every X seconds in addition to using the new config (such as the mirror strategy). Strategies such as the balanced strategy could switch over to using this new field though. - [x] [remove this line in sample_trader.cfg](https://github.com/stellar/kelp/blob/8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635/examples/configs/trader/sample_trader.cfg#L37) since fill tracking is supported in non-SDEX exchanges - [x] testing ## Your Environment cli version: master:nightly-33ab2afe-17-g8f927d83 gui version: v1.0.0-rc1 git branch: master git hash: 8f927d83870d94e838c97b94bc0c11e52c76b635 build date: 20200723T104331Z env: dev GOOS: linux GOARCH: amd64 ## Context I am unable to reliably run a trading strategy that depends on having consistent trade data because of this. relates to #306 and can be a possible solution.
